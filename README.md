# Definitorium
Chrome extension for getting definitions

### Overview ###
Isn't it annoying when you find a word you don't know in a delightful article or a nice book and you have to copy it, open another tab, paste it, pray to gods Google understands what you meant and find it's definition? If the gods are not in a good day, you must then open the [Cambridge English Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/) paste it there and find what you need THEN go back to the original page and resume your reading. 

...or, (if you're lazy like me) try to figure out the meaning from the context.

But that doesn't always work.

For those kind of moments, there is **Definitorium**.

**Definitorium** is a Chrome extension, soon to be available in the [Chrome Extension Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions), which gives you the  definition you need for that stubborn word you stooped at, without you leaving the page or doing any kind of spiritual incantation. 

All you have to do is select the word and then click the **Definitorium** icon and that's it! You have your definition right there !
 
Hurray ! 


### Details ### 

The extension uses the [Wordnik API](http://developer.wordnik.com/docs.html) to fetch definitions.
